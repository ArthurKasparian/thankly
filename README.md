# Thankful

## About
Thankly is a gratitude journaling application made as a passion project and to showcase my abilities.

This is the main repository for this project, where I also host the [website](https://thankly.arthurkasparian.dev) for this project, see [repositories](#repositories)

### Features
Simplified, Thankly is a note-taking application with a bit more visual sugar being the gratitude aspect of it. The main features of this application are:

- Note Entry
- Feed
- Categories/Tags
- Search/Filtering
- Favourites
- Calendar View
- Recycle Bin
- Note History (simple VCS)
- Settings/Preferences

### Usage
The concept of Thankly is fairly simple, after installing (installation guides in respective [repositories](#repositories)) it there's no mandatory login/signup needed as it is an offline-first application (meaning everything is stored on and retrievable from your device first), so you can start taking notes right away.

You'll have the ability to create daily entries, edit or deleted them, view their history, favourite specific notes and group them via user-made categories, you'll also be able to view streaks of consecutive days with note entries!
